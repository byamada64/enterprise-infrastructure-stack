# ☁️ Azure VM Provisioning + NGINX Deployment + Validation

## Build Summary

Provisioned an Azure Virtual Machine to evaluate infrastructure-based hosting, OS-level control, and network accessibility in a production-aligned scenario.

This build focuses on VM-based deployment tradeoffs versus platform services, incorporating Virtual Network (VNet), Network Security Groups (NSG), Public IP configuration, SSH access, and compute sizing (SKU) to validate connectivity, security boundaries, and operational control within a governed lab environment.

## 🏗️ Environment Build Choices

### 🏷️ Name and Tags

- VM Name: `az-lab-vm`
- Use consistent naming convention for tracking, automation, and scale.

### 💿 Operating System / Image

- Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
- Gen2 image
- Standard SSD supported
- 64-bit architecture

### ⚙️ Compute

- VM Size: `B1s`
- Low-cost burstable compute for lab testing

### 🔑 Access Method

- Created new SSH key pair
- Username: `azureuser`
- Downloaded private `.pem` key
- Stored securely after download

### 🌐 Networking

- Virtual Network: New
- Subnet: Default
- Public IP enabled for remote access
- Suitable for lab use; production may use private subnet model

### 🔥 Firewall

- Created dedicated Network Security Group
- SSH (22) allowed
- HTTP (80) allowed
- Rules can later be restricted to source IP

### 💾 Storage

- Default 30GB OS disk
- Changed Premium SSD to Standard SSD
- Delete disk with VM enabled

### 🧩 Advanced Options

- Left default unless workload required customization
- Can later expand for identity, monitoring, scripts, shutdown automation

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

- Launched Azure Ubuntu virtual machine
- Validated VM state = Running
- Captured Public IP address
- Connected via SSH key pair
- Updated packages
- Installed NGINX
- Enabled NGINX service
- Started NGINX service
- Tested browser access via Public IP
- Validated browser and CLI responses

## 💻 Commands Used

- `chmod 400 az-lab-vm_key.pem` — Secure private key permissions
- `ssh -i az-lab-vm_key.pem azureuser@public-ip` — Connect to Azure VM using SSH key
- `sudo apt update -y` — Refresh Ubuntu package repositories
- `sudo apt install nginx -y` — Install NGINX web server
- `sudo systemctl enable nginx` — Enable NGINX to start on boot
- `sudo systemctl start nginx` — Start NGINX service immediately
- `curl -I http://public-ip` — Validate HTTP response headers
- `top` — View real-time CPU and memory utilization

## ✅ Validation

- SSH login successful
- NGINX service active
- HTTP response returned
- Browser page reachable
- VM metrics visible in Azure portal

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- NSG rules control inbound traffic
- Public IP required for direct internet access
- Small VM sizes are sufficient for lightweight hosting
- Standard SSD is ideal for low-cost labs
- Consistent naming improves management clarity
- Temporary access rules should be removed after testing

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Terraform Azure VM deployment
- Ansible NGINX install automation
- Azure Monitor alerts
- HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt
- Azure Load Balancer front-end
- Private subnet + Bastion host model
- VM Scale Set testing

## 🧹 Final Hygiene Cleanup

### Cleanup Actions

- Stopped virtual machine
- Selected **Delete VM**
- Confirmed deletion
- Opened **Resource Manager / All Resources**
- Attempted full Resource Group deletion
- Deleted leftover resources manually when needed

### Removed Assets

- Public IP
- Network Security Group
- Virtual Network
- Network Interface
- SSH Key Resource

### Final Validation

- Confirmed no remaining billable assets
- Prevented future charges
- Returned environment to a clean state
