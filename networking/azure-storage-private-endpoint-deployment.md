# ☁️ Azure VM + Storage + Container + Private Endpoint Lab

## Build Summary

Provisioned a multi-service Azure environment integrating Virtual Machine, Storage Account, Container Instance, and Private Endpoint to evaluate secure service communication and private network access in a production-aligned scenario.

This build focuses on network isolation tradeoffs versus public exposure, incorporating Virtual Network (VNet), Subnet segmentation, Private Endpoint (PEP), Network Security Groups (NSG), and DNS resolution behavior to validate secure connectivity, access control, and service interaction within a governed lab environment.

### 🌐 Name Resolution Testing

- Used `nslookup` from Windows VM
- Confirmed DNS resolution behavior for storage endpoint
- Validated networking awareness during testing


## 📘 Lessons Learned

### 🖥️ VM

- Successful deployment does not guarantee access; ports, credentials, and client setup must also be validated.
- Trusted Launch adds strong baseline security controls.
- Cross-platform management from macOS to Azure Windows VMs is practical and efficient.

### 📦 Storage

- GPv2 accounts offer modern flexible storage options.
- LRS is cost-efficient for labs and non-critical testing.
- Public access may help testing but should be tightened later.

### 🗂️ Blob / SAS

- SAS URLs are useful for controlled temporary access.
- Safer than broadly exposing storage publicly.
- Static HTML uploads provide simple functional testing.

### 🐳 Containers

- Azure Container Instances are excellent for rapid temporary workloads.
- Great option for testing without managing full VM infrastructure.
- Ideal for demos, validation, and lightweight services.

### 🔒 Private Endpoint (PEP)

- Private Endpoints improve security posture by reducing public exposure.
- Correct subresource selection matters (`blob`, `file`, `queue`, etc.).
- DNS behavior should be validated during private access testing.

### 🌐 Networking

- Default VNets and subnets are effective for labs and rapid builds.
- Enterprise environments often require pre-planned network architecture and approvals.
- Networking choices impact later integrations such as PEP, NSGs, and DNS.

### 🏷️ Governance

- Tags help accounting, billing, ownership, automation, and cleanup.
- Strong tagging habits scale well in enterprise environments.

### 🧹 Operations

- Multi-service builds create dependencies that affect cleanup order.
- Temporary subscriptions may expire before cleanup completes.


## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Disable public storage access after testing
- Restrict RDP to trusted IP ranges only
- Add NSG hardening rules
- Integrate Private DNS Zones
- Deploy containers privately
- Use Terraform or Bicep for repeatable builds
- Add Azure Monitor / Log Analytics
- Automate tag policy enforcement


## 🧹 Final Hygiene Cleanup

- Reviewed temporary resources before expiration
- Attempted cleanup of lab services
- Confirmed dependency awareness across resources
- Used cost-conscious temporary sizing
- Preserved build notes for future rebuilds and automation
