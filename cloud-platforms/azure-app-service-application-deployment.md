# ☁️ Azure App Service Deployment

## Build Summary

Provisioned a managed Azure Web App using App Service to evaluate PaaS hosting, deployment workflows, and runtime behavior in a production-aligned scenario.

This build focuses on platform service tradeoffs versus VM-based deployments, incorporating RBAC access control, Managed Identity, Access Restrictions, App Service Plan (SKU) sizing, Application Settings configuration, and Monitoring through Application Insights within a governed lab environment.

## 💻 Commands Used

- `chmod 400 az-lab-vm_key.pem` — Secure private key permissions  
- `ssh -i az-lab-vm_key.pem azureuser@public-ip` — Connect to VM using SSH  
- `sudo apt update -y` — Refresh package repositories  
- `sudo apt install nginx -y` — Install NGINX  
- `sudo systemctl enable nginx` — Enable on boot  
- `sudo systemctl start nginx` — Start service  
- `curl -I http://public-ip` — Validate HTTP response  
- `top` — View live resource usage

## ✅ Validation

- Azure Web App created successfully  
- App status = Running  
- Runtime status = Healthy  
- Node 24 LTS recognized automatically  
- Linux App Service Plan attached  
- Public Azure hostname generated  
- Inbound public access enabled  
- Outbound IP addresses assigned  
- Restart / Stop / Delete controls visible  
- Deployment Center available

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Azure App Service removes need to manage OS patching and server maintenance  
- Runtime stack selection is critical for successful application startup  
- Premium tiers can become expensive quickly for simple labs  
- Networking and monitoring can be layered on after deployment  
- Managed platforms still require cost governance  
- Review screen is valuable for catching incorrect SKU choices before launch  

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Deploy via GitHub Actions CI/CD  
- Enable Application Insights monitoring  
- Configure custom domain + HTTPS certificate  
- Add deployment slots for blue/green releases  
- Integrate VNet for private backend access  
- Scale plan testing under load  
- Test lower-cost Basic / Free tiers for labs  

## 🧹 Final Hygiene Cleanup

- Stopped web app after validation  
- Deleted App Service resource  
- Deleted App Service Plan if no longer needed  
- Confirmed no leftover billable resources remained  
- Prevented unnecessary ongoing charges  
- Returned environment to clean state
