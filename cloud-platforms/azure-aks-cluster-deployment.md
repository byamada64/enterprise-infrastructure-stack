# ☸️ Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Deployment

## Build Summary

Provisioned an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster to evaluate managed container orchestration, workload deployment, and scaling behavior in a production-aligned scenario.

This build focuses on container platform tradeoffs versus VM-based and PaaS deployments, incorporating RBAC, node pool scaling, load balancing, networking (VNet), and monitoring (Azure Monitor / Application Insights) to validate operational control, resilience, and service exposure within a governed lab environment.

# 🏗️ Environment Build Choices

## Project Details

**Subscription:** Existing assigned lab subscription provided by training environment  
**Resource Group:** Existing approved Resource Group provided by sandbox tenant

## Notes

- Manual AKS creation attempts were initially blocked by policy restrictions
- Successful deployment path used **AKS Automatic Cluster**
- Existing subscription and Resource Group were required due to sandbox permissions
- Governed tenants often restrict VM sizes, add-ons, monitoring, or custom networking

# ✅ Validation

## Cluster Validation

- AKS cluster deployed successfully
- Kubernetes API reachable through `kubectl`
- Worker node status confirmed **Ready**
- Core system services healthy (`coredns`, `metrics-server`, `cilium`, `azure-policy`)

## Application Validation

- NGINX deployment created successfully
- Apache deployment created successfully
- Pod replicas scaled from **1 → 3 → 5**
- Rolling image update completed successfully
- All replicas reported healthy and available

## Networking Validation

- Azure LoadBalancer public IP assigned successfully
- External browser access reached NGINX welcome page
- End-to-end traffic flow validated from internet to pod

## Operational Validation

- Cluster metrics visible in Azure portal
- Node resource utilization visible
- Kubernetes events confirmed scheduling and rollout activity


# 🧠 Lessons Learned

- AKS Automatic mode can succeed where manual builds fail in restricted tenants
- Azure sandbox environments may enforce hidden policies on sizing and add-ons
- `LoadBalancer` services provision public IPs asynchronously
- `kubectl get events` is highly effective for troubleshooting deployments
- Rolling updates allow zero-downtime workload changes
- Horizontal scaling is fast and efficient with managed Kubernetes
- Browser validation provides stronger proof than CLI output alone
- Troubleshooting persistence is often more valuable than perfect first-pass deployment


# 🔮 Future Improvements

- Enable Managed Prometheus and Grafana in unrestricted tenant
- Integrate Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Deploy Ingress Controller with DNS hostname routing
- Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- Create multiple namespaces for workload separation
- Add persistent storage using Azure Disk / Azure Files
- Implement private AKS cluster model
- Automate cluster builds using Terraform or Bicep
- Add CI/CD pipeline deployment testing


# 🧹 Final Hygiene Cleanup

- Deleted NGINX service after validation
- Deleted NGINX deployment after testing
- Deleted Apache deployment after testing
- Confirmed no remaining workloads in default namespace
- Initiated AKS cluster deletion
- Left no unnecessary billable lab resources running
